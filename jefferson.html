                            <div class="accordion-content text-gray-700">The campaign was one of the most negative in American history. Federalists launched "whispering campaigns," accusing Jefferson of being a godless atheist who would destroy religion. They claimed his victory would mean "the Bible would be cast into a bonfire."<a href="#" class="citation" title="Meacham, Jon. Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power. Random House, 2012.">1</a> In turn, Democratic-Republicans portrayed Adams as a monarchist who wanted to create a new American dynasty. The real crisis began after the votes were counted. Due to a constitutional flaw, Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr, received the same number of electoral votes. The tie threw the election into the Federalist-controlled House of Representatives. Many Federalists preferred the ambitious Burr over their hated rival, Jefferson. For weeks, the nation teetered on the brink of chaos. It was <strong class="font-semibold">Alexander Hamilton</strong> who broke the deadlock. Despite his deep political disagreements with Jefferson, Hamilton considered him a man of principle, while he saw Burr as a dangerous and "unprincipled" opportunist. Hamilton lobbied Federalists to switch their votes, and on the 36th ballot, Jefferson was elected President.<a href="#" class="citation" title="Ferling, John. Adams vs. Jefferson: The Tumultuous Election of 1800. Oxford University Press, 2004.">2</a> This crisis directly led to the 12th Amendment, ensuring this type of tie would never happen again.</div>

                            <div class="accordion-content text-gray-700">Jefferson's first inaugural address was a call for national unity, famously stating, <strong class="font-semibold">"We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."</strong><a href="#" class="citation" title="Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1801. National Archives.">3</a> He immediately began to implement his vision of a limited government. With Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin, he dramatically cut the national debt, reduced the army and navy, and eliminated all internal taxes. However, his agenda faced a major challenge from the judiciary. In his final days, John Adams had appointed numerous Federalist judges—the "midnight judges"—to pack the courts. When Jefferson's Secretary of State, James Madison, refused to deliver the commission to one of these appointees, William Marbury, the case went to the Supreme Court. In the landmark 1803 decision of <strong class="font-semibold">Marbury v. Madison</strong>, Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that while Marbury was entitled to his commission, the law that would have forced Madison to deliver it was unconstitutional. This brilliant political move established the principle of <strong class="font-semibold">judicial review</strong>—the power of the Supreme Court to declare laws unconstitutional—a power that dramatically expanded the strength of the judiciary and continues to shape American law today.<a href="#" class="citation" title="Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803).">4</a></div>

                            <div class="accordion-content text-gray-700">In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte secretly forced Spain to return the vast Louisiana Territory to France through the Treaty of San Ildefonso. When Jefferson learned of this, he was alarmed. Spain was a weak power, but France was strong and ambitious. Jefferson wrote that the day France takes possession of New Orleans, <strong class="font-semibold">"we must marry ourselves to the British fleet and nation."</strong><a href="#" class="citation" title="Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Robert Livingston, April 18, 1802.">5</a> The situation became a full-blown crisis in 1802 when Spanish officials in New Orleans, on the eve of handing over the territory, revoked the American "right of deposit," closing the vital port to American trade. Western farmers were outraged, some even demanding war. To solve the crisis, Jefferson dispatched James Monroe to Paris to join the American minister, Robert Livingston, with instructions to purchase New Orleans and West Florida.</div>

                            <div class="accordion-content text-gray-700">The Louisiana Purchase created a profound internal conflict for Jefferson. His entire political philosophy was built on <strong class="font-semibold">strict constructionism</strong>—the belief that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly granted in the Constitution. Nowhere did the Constitution authorize the president to acquire foreign territory. This act seemed to align more with the Federalist view of broad, implied powers, which Jefferson had fought against his entire career. He wrote to a senator, "The constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our Union."<a href="#" class="citation" title="Letter from Thomas Jefferson to John C. Breckinridge, August 12, 1803.">6</a> He seriously considered passing a constitutional amendment to authorize the purchase, but his advisors warned him that Napoleon's offer was urgent and might be withdrawn. Ultimately, Jefferson chose what he saw as the practical good of the nation over his philosophical consistency. He justified his action under the president's treaty-making power, but privately admitted he had <strong class="font-semibold">"stretched the Constitution till it cracked."</strong><a href="#" class="citation" title="As quoted in a letter from Jefferson to Albert Gallatin, January 1803.">7</a> This decision set a major precedent for the expansion of presidential power.</div>

                            <div class="accordion-content text-gray-700">Livingston and Monroe arrived in Paris to find Napoleon in a completely different frame of mind. The Haitian Revolution had succeeded, costing him thousands of troops and derailing his dreams of a New World empire. With war against Britain looming, he needed money fast. His finance minister famously advised him, "I renounce Louisiana... It is not only New Orleans that I will cede, it is the whole colony without any reservation." He offered the entire territory—828,000 square miles—for the stunningly low price of <strong class="font-semibold">$15 million</strong>. Acting far beyond their instructions, the American diplomats seized the opportunity. The Senate ratified the treaty, and with a stroke of a pen, the United States had doubled in size, gaining a territory that would eventually become all or part of 15 states.</div>

                            <div class="accordion-content text-gray-700">Jefferson, a man of the Enlightenment, envisioned the expedition as a scientific endeavor. He sent his personal secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to Philadelphia to be trained by the nation's top scientists in botany, zoology, and celestial navigation.<a href="#" class="citation" title="Ambrose, Stephen E. Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West. Simon & Schuster, 1996.">8</a> Their primary goals were to find the fabled Northwest Passage, to establish American sovereignty and trade relations with Native American tribes, and to meticulously document the West's geography, resources, and inhabitants. They carried scientific instruments, reference books, and gifts for the tribes, functioning as a mobile research unit for the young republic.</div>

Its success depended on its diverse members. <strong class="font-semibold">Sacagawea</strong>, the Shoshone wife of a French fur trader, was crucial. Beyond being a symbol of peace, she saved vital records and instruments when a boat capsized and her linguistic skills were indispensable. Her reunion with her brother, the Shoshone chief, secured the horses needed to cross the treacherous Rocky Mountains. <strong class="font-semibold">York</strong>, William Clark's enslaved servant, was a vital contributor whose physical strength and novelty to the tribes aided in diplomatic encounters. Despite being a slave, he was allowed a vote in key expedition decisions, a remarkable fact for the era. The journey was a testament to their collective resilience and cross-cultural collaboration.</div>

They had failed to find an all-water route to the Pacific, but their achievements were immense. Their detailed journals and meticulously drawn maps, particularly Clark's, became the blueprint for westward expansion. They described 178 new plants and 122 new animals.<a href="#" class="citation" title="Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition, University of Nebraska-Lincoln.">9</a> Their diplomatic efforts, while mixed, established the first official U.S. presence among the powerful tribes of the Missouri and Columbia River Basins. The expedition fired the national imagination, creating an image of the West as a land of boundless opportunity and adventure that would fuel the concept of "Manifest Destiny" for decades to come.</div>
