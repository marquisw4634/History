            <h2>👋 Welcome, Future Historians! 👋</h2>
            <p>The year is 1787. The brand-new United States of America is... well, not doing so great. The first set of rules, the <strong>Articles of Confederation</strong>, made the central government too weak. Think of it like a group project where no one is really in charge – chaos, right? So, leaders from most of the states met in Philadelphia during a hot summer to try and fix things. This meeting was called the <strong>Constitutional Convention</strong>. Their goal? To create a new, stronger framework for the government. But it wasn't easy! Let's see what went down.</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <p><strong>🤫 Did You Know?</strong> The delegates swore to keep their discussions secret! They didn't want outside pressure or public opinion to sway their debates. Windows were kept closed even in the summer heat to ensure privacy!</p>

                <div id="debate1" class="debate-content hidden">
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> How should states be represented in the new Congress? Big states (like Virginia) wanted representation based on population (more people = more votes). Small states (like New Jersey) wanted equal representation (every state gets the same number of votes, no matter its size).</p>
                    <p><strong>The Sides:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Virginia Plan (Big States):</strong> Two houses in Congress, both with representation based on population.</li>
                        <li><strong>New Jersey Plan (Small States):</strong> One house in Congress, with equal votes for each state.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome: The Great Compromise (or Connecticut Compromise) 🎉</strong></p>
                    <p>They created a <strong>bicameral</strong> (two-house) Congress:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The House of Representatives:</strong> Representation based on state population (pleased the big states).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Senate:</strong> Each state gets two Senators, regardless of population (pleased the small states).</li>

                <div id="debate2" class="debate-content hidden">
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> This was a deeply divisive issue. Southern states wanted enslaved people to be counted for representation in Congress (to get more power) but not for taxation. Northern states generally opposed this.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Sides:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Southern States:</strong> Argued enslaved individuals should boost their population counts for more representatives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Northern States:</strong> Argued that if enslaved people were considered property for other purposes, they shouldn't be counted for representation, or if they were, they should also be counted for taxation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome: The Three-Fifths Compromise 😔</strong></p>
                    <p>A grim compromise was reached: For purposes of both representation and taxation, three-fifths of the enslaved population would be counted. This meant that for every five enslaved people, three would be added to the state's population count. The convention also agreed to not ban the slave trade for at least 20 years (until 1808).</p>
                    <div class="did-you-know">
                        <p><strong>💔 Historical Note:</strong> The compromises over slavery had tragic long-term consequences, contributing to the tensions that eventually led to the Civil War. The Constitution, in its original form, did not abolish slavery.</p>

                <div id="debate3" class="debate-content hidden">
                    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> After living under a powerful king, many were wary of giving one person too much authority. But the weak executive under the Articles of Confederation wasn't working either. How strong should the new national leader (the President) be, and how should they be chosen?</p>
                    <p><strong>The Sides:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strong Executive Advocates:</strong> Wanted a single president with significant powers, possibly elected for a long term or even life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Executive Advocates:</strong> Feared a single powerful executive, preferring a weaker council or an executive elected by the legislature for a short term.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The Outcome: A Single President with Checks ⚖️</strong></p>
                    <p>They decided on a single President, elected for a four-year term. To prevent tyranny, the President's powers would be limited by the other branches of government (Congress and the courts). The method of election was also a compromise: the <strong>Electoral College</strong>. Instead of a direct popular vote, citizens vote for electors who then cast the official votes for President.</p>

            <h2>📜 A "Living Document" & Why It Matters Today 📜</h2>
            <p>The Constitution wasn't perfect (as the compromises on slavery showed), but it created a flexible framework for government that has lasted over 235 years! It's often called a "living document" because it can be changed through <strong>amendments</strong> (official additions or changes). There have been 27 amendments so far, including the Bill of Rights (the first 10 amendments, protecting individual freedoms).</p>
            <p>Understanding the debates, compromises, and structure of the Constitution helps us understand how our government works today and why certain issues are still debated. It's the rulebook for our nation, and knowing the rules is the first step to being an informed citizen!</p>
            <div class="did-you-know">
                <p><strong>🤓 Who were some key players?</strong> George Washington (President of the Convention), James Madison ("Father of the Constitution" for his notes and ideas), Alexander Hamilton (strong national government advocate), Roger Sherman (key to the Great Compromise), and Benjamin Franklin (the wise old statesman offering guidance).</p>
