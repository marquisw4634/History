            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Imagine it's the middle of the American Revolutionary War. The Second Continental Congress started drafting the <span class="vocab">Articles of Confederation</span> in 1777, and they were finally <span class="vocab">ratified</span> (approved) by all 13 states in 1781 ‚Äì while the war was still being fought! This was the first <span class="vocab">constitution</span> (written plan of government) for the "United States of America."</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Because they were created during a war against a powerful king, the Articles aimed to create a <span class="vocab">confederation</span> ‚Äì a "league of friendship" where states worked together, especially for war, but kept most of their own power. The goal was to have enough unity to fight Britain, but not so much that the central government became a new tyrant.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">The main job of the government under the Articles was to manage the Revolutionary War effort and deal with foreign countries. The colonists were fighting to escape the strong control of King George III, so they were terrified of creating another powerful national government.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 pl-4">
                <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Successfully wage war against Great Britain and secure independence. This meant Congress needed powers to declare war, make treaties (like the alliance with France), raise an army (by asking states for troops), and borrow money for the war.</li>
                <li><strong>BIG Fear:</strong> A central government that could become oppressive, like the British monarchy. They wanted to protect the <span class="vocab">sovereignty</span> (supreme power) of individual states.</li>
                <li><strong>The Compromise:</strong> A weak central government with specific, limited powers mostly related to war and diplomacy. States kept most of the day-to-day governing power.</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">This <span class="vocab">uprising</span> of farmers in Massachusetts became a symbol of the Articles' failures. Here's why it was such a big deal:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-3 pl-4">
                    <li><strong>The Farmers' Plight:</strong> After the war, many farmers, including former soldiers, faced crushing <span class="vocab">debt</span>. The Massachusetts government raised taxes to pay off its war debts, and demanded payment in hard currency (gold/silver), which was scarce. Farmers who couldn't pay lost their farms and sometimes faced debtors' prison.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Rebellion:</strong> Led by Daniel Shays, a Revolutionary War veteran, these angry farmers began to protest. They shut down courts to prevent judges from foreclosing on farms. They wanted the state to print more paper money and pass laws to help debtors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak National Response:</strong> Massachusetts asked the Confederation Congress for help to put down the rebellion. But Congress had no power to raise a national army without consent from other states, and no money to pay for one. It was largely powerless to act.</li>
                    <li><strong>State Action & Aftermath:</strong> Eventually, the Massachusetts state <span class="vocab">militia</span>, funded by wealthy Boston merchants, suppressed the rebellion. While Shays' followers were defeated, the event sent shockwaves across the country.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Impact ‚Äì A Call for Change:</strong> Shays' Rebellion terrified many wealthy landowners, merchants, and national leaders like George Washington and James Madison. It exposed the dangerous weaknesses of the national government under the Articles. If the government couldn't maintain order and protect property, they feared the new nation could fall into <span class="vocab">anarchy</span> (chaos, lack of government) or split apart. This fear was a major catalyst that led to the call for a convention in Philadelphia in 1787, originally to <span class="vocab">revise</span> the Articles, but ultimately to replace them with the U.S. <span class="vocab">Constitution</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 italic font-semibold">Shays' Rebellion dramatically highlighted that a stronger national government was needed to ensure domestic peace and stability.</p>
